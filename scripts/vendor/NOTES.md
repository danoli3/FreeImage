# Vendored codec integration

Current vendored releases (issue #137, updated for issue #148):

| Library | Upstream tag | Commit | Library sources |
|---|---|---|---|
| libdeflate | `v1.26` | `92e6a0db9fa848d742f9eb286c92afc60f2c3dda` | `common_defs.h`, `libdeflate.h`, `lib/` |
| libtiff | `v4.7.2` | `d01a94be176f5f6a87f7ee1c0b32e65416aa2b4d` | `libtiff/`, plus `port/libport.h` |
| OpenEXR | `v3.5.2` | `69b2604fc76e370615438bdc8d2cd95b9349c12e` | `src/lib/{Iex,IlmThread,OpenEXR,OpenEXRCore}` |

OpenEXR's `OpenEXR` library directory maps to `Source/OpenEXR/IlmImf`.
Its installed-style `Imath/` include prefixes are removed because this fork
keeps Imath headers flat under `Source/Imath`. Keep the checked-in portable
configuration headers, update version numbers and internal namespaces together,
and preserve the include-order guards in `OpenEXRCore/openexr_version.h`.
The upstream ARM64EC SIMD guards are now present in 3.5.1.

OpenEXR's auxiliary Zstandard 1.5.7 and OpenJPH 0.32.0 snapshots come from
that same tag's `external/` tree, including their licenses. CMake and GNU/macOS
make enable OpenJPH's runtime-dispatched x86 kernels by default. Each SSE,
SSE2, SSSE3, AVX, AVX2, and AVX512 source group gets its own compiler flags;
scalar and CPU-detection sources keep the baseline ISA. Unsupported compiler
flags omit that group and disable its dispatch references. CMake handles MSVC,
clang-cl, cross targets, and macOS universal builds. The header opt-in and
actual compiler target checks keep ARM64/ARM64EC and other targets portable;
this snapshot has no ARM SIMD kernels. VSX and WASM kernels are not integrated.

Use `-DFREEIMAGE_OPENJPH_SIMD=OFF` with CMake or `FREEIMAGE_OPENJPH_SIMD=0`
with make for a portable build. Use a separate build directory (or clean make
objects) when changing the option. The C allocation helper uses its upstream
portable aligned-allocation fallback. Zstandard uses its C implementation
with `ZSTD_DISABLE_ASM`; preserve the ARM64EC exclusions in
`common/{compiler.h,cpu.h,portability_macros.h}` so `_M_X64` does not select
x86 intrinsics or CPUID on ARM64EC.

The Linux ARM CPU detector requests `_GNU_SOURCE` before system headers so
`O_CLOEXEC` is available under strict C11, including the GNU make path.

libdeflate 1.26 requires C11 (MSVC 2019 16.8 or later). CMake applies C11
specifically to its sources; GNU make defaults to C11. Upstream now excludes ARM64EC
from x86 detection and uses its portable fallback there.

libtiff retains FreeImage's checked-in `tif_config.h` and `tiffconf.h`;
`tiffvers.h` is substituted from the upstream template. Preserve these local
patches when re-importing:

- `tif_predict.c` excludes ARM64EC from the `_M_X64` SSE guards.
- `tif_win32.c` omits allocation/memory helpers supplied by `PluginTIFF.cpp`.
- `tif_config.h` uses `"zu"` for `size_t` and `PRId64` for this fork's
  `int64_t` signed size type, without a leading `%`.

The full 4.7.2 sync moves cursor fields into `TIFFDirectory`; the G3 loader
uses `tif_dir.td_row`. PixarLog now includes the decompression-ratio hook.

Always reconcile upstream CMake library source lists with both FreeImage
build paths. Include generated tables and their initialization helpers,
but exclude table-generator executables (`b44ExpLogTable.cpp`, `dwaLookups.cpp`).
After an update, run TestAPI and EXR/TIFF/G3 round trips, including EXR's new
compression methods and variable-sample deep ZSTD data, with AddressSanitizer.
Windows, ARM64EC, and Linux GNU make validation belongs in the existing CI matrix.

OpenEXRCore ZSTD uses posix_memalign on Android below API 28, where
aligned_alloc is unavailable. Preserve its 64-byte alignment, overflow
checks, and matching free cleanup when refreshing the vendor snapshot.

OpenJPH's AVX2 encoder includes the upstream MSVC 2022 Win32 Debug
compiler-crash workaround from [OpenJPH #395](https://github.com/aous72/OpenJPH/pull/395).
Copy the referenced previous context value into a local before inserting it
into the SIMD vector. Preserve this patch until the bundled snapshot includes it.

libpng 1.6.59 comes from v1.6.59 (cd952f49f95bb27154ae77dbb103032d95f6e580).
Its prebuilt pnglibconf.h changes only the version comment; retain this fork's
configuration. Library source lists are unchanged for both codec updates.

OpenEXR 3.5.2 introduces OpenJPH NLT lookup tables for lossy LJ2K and a
compatibility fallback for files written by 3.5.0/3.5.1 without the tables.
Regenerate those older lossy LJ2K files for best results, per upstream notes.
The Zstandard and OpenJPH snapshots are unchanged; retain all local patches above.
