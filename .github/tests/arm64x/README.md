# Experimental Windows ARM64X DLL validation

The `Windows ARM64X experiment` workflow builds FreeImage twice using MSVC:
ARM64 and ARM64EC, with matching C++17 and static CRT settings. It captures the
native linker inputs with `/LINKREPROFULLPATHRSP`, then relinks the EC objects
with those native objects/libraries using `/MACHINE:ARM64X`. The original two
DLLs are retained as runtime controls. This creates a merged binary, rather
than a forwarder that depends on two additional FreeImage DLLs.

Debug and Release artifacts run on `windows-11-arm`. Separate ARM64, ARM64EC
and x64 test programs dynamically load the exact same hybrid DLL. The programs
exercise public exports, allocation, pixels and memory/custom-I/O round trips
for PNG, TIFF, WebP, JP2, JXR and JPEG. Lossless formats must retain the source
pixels; all formats must decode identically through the two input APIs.
Unmerged native/EC controls must work in matching consumers and fail to load
in the incompatible consumer. SHA-256 checks ensure downloaded artifacts and
the shared DLL are unchanged.

The wrapper CMake project leaves the production FreeImage build unchanged.
Default bundled libraries, including OpenEXR, LibRaw and JXR, are compiled.
Optional HEIF/JPEG XL bundles are outside this initial experiment. Windows
ARM64 runtime checks are required: an x64-hosted cross-build alone cannot
validate the ARM64 loader's two personalities.

MSVC from VS 2022 17.11 or newer is required. To reproduce on a Windows x64
build host with the ARM64/ARM64EC toolsets installed:

```powershell
./.github/tests/arm64x/build.ps1 -Configuration Release `
  -BuildRoot "$env:TEMP/arm64x-build" -OutputRoot "$env:TEMP/arm64x-artifacts"
```

Copy `arm64x-artifacts` to a Windows ARM64 system, then run:

```powershell
./.github/tests/arm64x/run.ps1 -Artifacts ./arm64x-artifacts
```

GitHub Actions uploads the DLLs, consumers, PE/export reports and checksums as
short-lived test artifacts. They are not release packages. The CMake approach
follows [Microsoft's ARM64X build documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/arm64x-build).
